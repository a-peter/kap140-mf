- u8g2 by oliver, version 2.34.22

## Adding ESP32 to Arduino IDE

In the settings, add `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json` as
an additional _boards manager URL_.

Inside the _Boards Manager_ filter for *esp32* and select *esp32* by
*Espressif Systems*. This might take a while to finish. To connect to the
ESP select the *ESP32 Dev Module*.
